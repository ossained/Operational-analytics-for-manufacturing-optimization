Project Title: Analyzing Production Efficiency and Downtime Factors in a Soda Manufacturing Plant

Problem Statement:
The goal of this analysis is to assess production efficiency by examining batch production times, identifying major downtime causes, and understanding operator performance. 
We aim to highlight inefficiencies and suggest improvements for optimized production

Key Questions to Answer:

Production Analysis:
What is the total number of batches produced per product and flavor?
Which product size has the highest and lowest production volume?

Efficiency Check:
Calculate the average production time per product and compare it with the minimum batch time
Identify batches that exceeded the minimum required production time and compute the percentage of inefficient batches

Downtime Analysis:
What are the top three most common downtime factors?
What percentage of total downtime is attributed to operator errors?
Identify the operators with the highest and lowest total downtime in their batches

Performance Comparison:
Compare total production time for different operators and rank them based on efficiency
Find the operator with the highest number of batches that exceeded the minimum batch time

Create a report combining batches with downtime and batches without downtime, ensuring all batches are included
