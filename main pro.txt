1. Batch Efficiency (Production Times and Variations)
Goal: Understand time variations for producing different products and assess the impact of downtime.
What is the average production time for each product?
How do production times vary between products (e.g., flavors and sizes)?
Which products consistently take the longest to produce?
What is the variance in production time by operator for the same product?

2. Downtime Causes (Identifying Reasons for Delays)
Goal: Identify downtime factors and their impacts on production efficiency.
What are the main downtime factors (operator error, equipment failure, etc.)?
Which downtime factors are most frequent across products?
How does downtime affect the overall production timeline for each product?
What is the average downtime per batch for each downtime factor?
Which downtime factors lead to the longest delays in production?

3. Operator Performance (Evaluating Operatorsâ€™ Impact on Production)
Goal: Assess operator performance and identify patterns related to production delays.
How do production times vary by operator for the same product?
Which operators have the highest and lowest average production times?
How do different operators contribute to downtime (e.g., operator error)?
Are there patterns in downtime related to specific operators?

4. Product Performance (Identifying Bottlenecks)
Goal: Identify products prone to downtime and recommend improvements.
Which products experience the most downtime during production?
Are there specific downtime factors that are more prominent for certain products?
Which products have the longest and most inconsistent production times?
Can we categorize products by their average production time (fast, moderate, slow)?
Which products have the greatest potential for optimization in terms of production time?
